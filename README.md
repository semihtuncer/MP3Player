<h1>An MP3 Player I Made Using ESP32 and Custom PCB's.</h1>
<p>Since I was bothered by the heavy phone in my pocket when going to the gym, I made myself a lighter and faster MP3 player. The PCB is a shield for ESP32-WEMOS-D1-MINI, that fits perfectly to the ESP. There is no need for another phone, device works by itself. There is a SD card slot. External battery managment module (TP4056 w/ LiPo) needs to be connected.</p>
